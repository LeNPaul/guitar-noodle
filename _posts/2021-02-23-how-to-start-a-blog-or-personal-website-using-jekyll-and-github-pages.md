This guide will walk you through the process from beginning to end of creating your GitHub account, choosing a Jekyll theme, making changes to your Jekyll theme, adding blog posts, and publishing your site through your own domain. Programming ability is not required for this guide.

#### Create a GitHub account

In order to get your Jekyll site hosted on GitHub Pages, you will need to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.

#### Find a Jekyll Theme

Jekyll has a massive community to Jekyll fanatics that create their own themes. There are plenty of professional looking themes that you can use completely for free.

#### Import Your Jekyll Theme

Every Jekyll theme should have a GitHub repository that you can find and download.
