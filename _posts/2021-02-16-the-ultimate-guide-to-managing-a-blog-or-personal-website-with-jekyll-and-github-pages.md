I first discovered Jekyll and GitHub pages in my second last year of university. During that time I was looking to learn programming in order to pursue a career in software development, and I had read that Jekyll and GitHub pages were a good platform to start your personal website or blog on.

However, being new to this, all of the resources that I came across for Jekyll and GitHub Pages were intimidating and confusing for me. Several years later, now that I do work in the software industry and have even created [a few Jekyll themes](https://github.com/LeNPaul) that are used by many, I realize that the confusion that I had in the beginning was unnecessary. Using Jekyll and GitHub Pages as a platform for starting your blog or personal website is actually very simple.

This series will walk you through everything you need to know in order to become a master at Jekyll and GitHub Pages, from getting started with your blogging or personal website to creating your own Jekyll themes.

#### What is Jekyll?

[The official Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/) states that Jekyll is "a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites". This is actually a good summary of what Jekyll is, but for a beginner can be confusing. Let's break down what each part means.

##### Simple

Contrary to the initial introduction that I had with Jekyll, it is very simple to use. Posts are written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is very easy to learn and once set up, adding new pages or posts is a matter of adding markdown text files to a directory. Jekyll handles the rest with building your site. There are no bloated user interfaces to work with, and your content is portable and completely controlled by you as they are just text files.

##### Blog-Aware

Jekyll was developed with blogging as the main use case. Typical features of blogs such as categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are supported. There is also a massive community of Jekyll users and free Jekyll themes to choose from.

##### Static Site Generator

A static site is a site that consists of only text files. There are no databases or servers that are required for the site to operate. Jekyll will take your text files which contain your blog posts, and generate a static site that is served as your blog or personal website.

##### For Personal, Project, or Organization Sites

Jekyll is suitable for sites that don't require databases for storing information such as users, for example. This turns out to be the majority of websites that you end up managing for your personal use will be static sites, and these are the easiest to set up and maintain.

#### What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is powered by Jekyll. What this means is GitHub offers the ability to host Jekyll sites - the files that make up your Jekyll site are served by the GitHub Pages servers. You can put your Jekyll blog in a GitHub repository, and GitHub will serve your Jekyll site as a public website. This is offerred for free, and is a great way to get started with blogging or your personal website completely free.

Using GitHub Pages to host your Jekyll site is great for starting out, especially if you are not immediately expecting high volumes of traffic to your site. Combined with your own custom domain name, you can get started with your online presence for a very affordable cost.

#### Why You Should Start a Blog or Personal Website

Having an online presence is important, whether or not you are a full-time blogger or software developer.
