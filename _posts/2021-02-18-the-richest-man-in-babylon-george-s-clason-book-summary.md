The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason is a classic book on personal finance. I first read this book while in the middle of university, and since graduating, the advice given in this book has proven to be valuable and timeless.

#### Seven Cures For a Lean Purse

1. Start thy purse to fattening

2. Control thy expenditures

3. Make thy gold multiply

4. Guard thy treasures from loss

5. Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment

6. Insure a future income

7. Increase thy ability to earn

#### The Five Laws of Gold

1. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than
one-tenth of his earngs to create an estate for his future and that of his family.

2. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable
employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.

3. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of
men wise in its handling.

4. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which
he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.

5. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the
alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic
desires in investment.
